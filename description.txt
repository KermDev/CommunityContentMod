Head over to our discord and look out for our ccmod category, here there is an info channel :)

currently there is :

there is to be expected to be inabalance in quality over certain weapons, items, or any content for that matter, this may or may not improve over time, we have a voting system for sprites, code etc to try keep some sort of balance, so dont be alarmed if theres any differences in quality :)
